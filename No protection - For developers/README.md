## General notes for users and developers: ##

This excel spreadsheet is the exact copy of the main one, '5. User - Standard datasheet Life Tables.xlsx', however any protection is removed.
As indicated in the main README file, the protection is just a safety measure to prevent accidental misprints that might affect the normal funcitoning of the file.
This version, instead, is without any protection and can be 100% modified.
Please, take in mind:

1. If you are a user, your should use the protected version, as the probability of misprints and weird results is reduced.
2. If you are a developer, or you want to better explore how the excel file works, please use this version. In case you think that there is an improvement or a change that can might be done (or a bug that might be corrected!!) feel free to do it and share the revised version with the scientific community. Any support from us is provided, you can write an email to luca.rossini@ulb.be or luca.rossini@unitus.it.

Together, is better!
