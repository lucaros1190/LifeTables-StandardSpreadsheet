# StandardDataCollection-LifeTablesFile

The purpose behind this work is to help the community of entomologists and all the insiders involved in rearing insects under different constant conditions in a laboratory environment. The lack of a standard in data collection and sharing led us to create this file, with the hope to endorse the open data practices in entomology.

# How to use/compile the Excel file

- _DatasetOverview_: This tab is fundamental for different reasons. It contains all the information about the species reared, the research group that conducted the experiment, and the definition of the experimental conditions and of the labels that denotes the stages. Proceeding by order:
    - Fill the entomological data about the species;
    - Indicate what the different raw data tabs "Cond-n" indicate. Let us consider a practical example: if "Cond-1" indicates the experiment where individuals were reared at 10°C, the label for "Cond-1" can be 10C. The labels corresponding to the unused tabs, should be left blank or denoted with "--".
    - Indicate the labels corresponding to the different life stages. Note that those labels will be the same you will indicate while inserting the data in the "Cond-n" tabs. For your convenience, the cells of the "Cond-n" tabs will be automatically coloured, so that you can notice if there is a misprint while inserting the data. An example of stage-labels is provided in the Excel file. Your species may have a lower number of stage than the Excel file. Don't panic: just denote the unused stages with "--". The same is applied to adult males in case of parthenogenetic species!
    - You are free to use (in a gooood and exaustive way) the textbox on the right. Here you may indicate the general goal of the experiment as for instance why you reared the species under the different conditions. Moreover, you may provide all the details of the rearing protocol in an exaustive way. This will be helpful for two reasons: the first one is the reproducibility of the results by the scientific community, while the second is for yourself and the manuscript you will probably write after the data collection and analysis. Consider this textbox as a mix between a logbook (it reminds you and your colleagues what you did!) and a materials and method section of a manuscript (and if you do it well, you just need to copy-paste it, in line with the low-energy principle).
