# StandardDataCollection-LifeTablesFile

The purpose behind this work is to help the community of entomologists and all the insiders involved in rearing insects under different constant conditions in a laboratory environment. The lack of a standard in data collection and sharing led us to create this file, with the hope to endorse the open data practices in entomology.
